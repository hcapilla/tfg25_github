# Automation of Synoptics for Industry 4.0 with Computer Vision

## Abstract  
This work presents a Python-based tool for automating the renewal of synoptics in Industry 4.0. Starting from an initial image, the system employs computer vision techniques, such as OCR and Template Matching, to identify texts, industrial elements, and connections between the various components of the synoptic diagram. The result is a scalable SVG-format diagram with data structures that enable efficient modification and updating. The tool significantly reduces work time while maintaining the fidelity of the original design and assisting the user in streamlining the design process.
